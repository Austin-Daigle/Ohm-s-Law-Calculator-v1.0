# Ohm's Law Calculator v1.0
This is a Java application for solving for voltage, current, or resistance. This program was in 2017 as a part of an AP Computer Science class project. This program can take two known variables (either voltage, current, or resistance) to solve for the unknown (either voltage, current, or resistance).

# How to use:
Download the attached [executable .jar application](https://github.com/Austin-Daigle/Ohm-s-Law-Calculator-v1.0/blob/main/Ohm's%20Law%20Calculator%20v1.0.jar) and execute and the java-based GUI will start-up.
Alternately, the program can also be run by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/Austin-Daigle/Ohm-s-Law-Calculator-v1.0/tree/main/SourceCode) and compiling/executing each java class via a command line/IDE or the classes for the source code can be introduced into the Eclipse IDE and exported as a .jar executable.

Upon executing the program, a GUI will pop up and ask the user which variable the user wants to solve for the user can input either "Voltage," "current" or "Resistance" to go onto the following prompt.

Then the user inputs a number for the variable option depending on the solving for the above input.

Then the user inputs that value,

then a prompt appears for inputting the final know variable (this depends on which variable the user chooses before this prompt).

Then a final prompt is generated with the correct answer.
